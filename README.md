## About this project
This is a project about a simple weather map. 
Basically, it's a search engine that fetch's 
data from the "https://openweathermap.org/"
api and uses that data to display various
current weather information using city
locations. It is a simple project and I
could not put much time into it. However,
it was nonetheless a great learning experience
with react and a beginner step to learn a lot
more about api usage. I used a lot of youtube
videos, and information from various different
sites such as 'stackoverflow' and the official
react website.

I learned a lot about fetching data. I love
the fact that there are websites that are
providing such great free resources. This
project also helped me polish my css skills.
I was able to slowly get better at creating
the image I see in my head and putting it
to code. I was glad to learn about the difference
between syntax when creating functions instead of
classes.

This project is very much incomplete and basic.
However, I will definitely soon come back to this
and satisfy myself about this project.Overall, it
was a great learning experience but also a great
way to realize I have a long way to go.
