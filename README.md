## About this project
This is a project about a simple weather map. 
Basically, it's a search engine that fetch's 
data from the "https://openweathermap.org/"
api and uses that data to display various
current weather information using city
locations. It is a simple project and I
could not put much time into it. However,
it was nonetheless a great learning experience
with react and a beginner step to learn a lot
more about api usage.

This project is very much incomplete and basic.
However, I will definitely soon come back to this
and satisfy myself about this project.
